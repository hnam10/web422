                        The Metropolitan Museum of Art, colloquially "the Met", is the largest art
                        museum in the Americas. Its permanent collection contains over two million
                        works, divided among 17 curatorial departments.

                    <p>
                        The museum was founded in 1870 to bring art and art education to the
                        American people. Its collection includes works of art from classical
                        antiquity and ancient Egypt, paintings and sculptures from nearly all the
                        European masters, and an extensive collection of American and modern art.
